# 🎮 Welcome to the **Helteix** Library!

For years, I’ve been working with Unity and building custom tools to streamline my development workflow.  
**Helteix** is a collection of carefully crafted packages designed to enhance your Unity projects, based on four key principles:

---

### ⚡ 1. **Performance First**
Most of these tools serve as foundational systems in games — meaning performance is critical.  
Many packages take full advantage of Unity’s **Burst compiler**, others leverage the **Job System**, and most are built around **struct-based design**.  
Every line of code is optimized to deliver the best possible performance. 🏎️

---

### 🧩 2. **Flexibility**
Helteix isn’t about dropping a black-box solution into your project.  
Instead, it offers **robust and scalable APIs** that integrate seamlessly with your architecture.  
All systems are designed to **adapt** rather than **impose** — using **interfaces** or **inheritance**, you stay in control. 🔧

---

### 🛠️ 3. **Simple to Use, Fully Customizable**
Each API is **generic** and **interface-based**, offering powerful extensibility without added complexity.  
We include ready-to-use components, but everything is built to be extended — so you can make each tool your own. 🎯

---

### 🖱️ 4. **Editor Integration**
Developer tools are great — but collaboration is even better.  
Every system includes **custom editor extensions**, making it easier for non-developers (designers, artists, etc.) to interact with the tools directly in the Unity Editor. 🧑‍🎨
