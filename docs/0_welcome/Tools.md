**Tools** is a collection of handy, quality-of-life utilities I use every day and want to share with the community.  
Each tool is standalone—this package is basically a toolbox where I gather all the small but useful features I create over time.  
Most of my other assets depend on this package.

Here are some highlights of what you’ll find inside:
- **SerializedComponents**: Add scripts to ScriptableObjects (or virtually any object) just like MonoBehaviours on GameObjects.
- **Notes**: Attach notes to assets, folders, or basically anything in your project for better organization.
- **Settings**: Easily create and manage settings for your own systems—perfect for A/B testing, global game metrics, or custom player preferences.
- **DynamicBuffers**: An optimized way to iterate over a list while safely modifying it.
