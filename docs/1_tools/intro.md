# Installation Guide

This page shows you how to install the package.
## Contents

## Introduction
Since the package **com.helteix.tools** is free, you can either install the package from my [GitHub page](https://github.com/Helteix/Tools) or from the Unity Asset store.

:::info[Which should I choose?]
It is recommended to stick with Asset Store's version for more stability.
